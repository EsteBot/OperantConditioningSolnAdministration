This program was created using MedState Notation (MedState Notation (MSN) is a programming language used to operate Med Associates Operant Chambers. MSN procedures are compiled into DLL files that can be executed by Med-PC, which is the operating system that runs the MSN procedures). This operant behavioral program delivers a specific amount of liquid solution to an animal after a correct lever press response along with a cue light. The liquid reward delivery is followed by a “time-out” period in which lever pressing, although recorded, does not result in liquid delivery. The program not only controls behavioral parameters, but also the data collected, being timestamped lever presses and rewards delivered.
